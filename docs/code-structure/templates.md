# Templates
This folder contains the templates used by the website to render the front-end with [`Jinja`](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/).

## What is it ?
Those files are used to render dinamically the front-end based on the data provided by the back-end.

## How does it work ?
Jinja uses a specific syntax to inject data into the html template as follows:

```jinja
#Example
{% if variable %}
    <p>{{ variable }}</p>
{% endif %}
```
You can find more on the [Jinja documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/#the-template-language).
