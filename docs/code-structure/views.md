# Views
This folder contains the functions that are used to render the front-end of the website and the routes of the website.

## What is it ?
The views rely on the templates and the controllers to render the front-end of the website. They receive the data from the back-end and render the front-end via Jinja [`templates`](templates.md).

## How does it work ?
Routes are triggered whenever the user access a certain URL as follows:

```python
#Example
@login_required
@main.route("/categories", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def categories():  # Categories list
    args = CategoryController.list(request.args)
    #Code to create the variables used to render the template
    
    #Render via Jinja
    return render_template(
        "categories.html",
        categories=args,
        #Other variables
    )
```
