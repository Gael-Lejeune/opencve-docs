# Commands

## What is it ?
This folder containes the code that is responsible for the different commands that can be used by the user in a CLI (command line interface).

## How does it work ?

### How to use it ?
If you choosed to install the application manually, you can use commands in you CLI as follows:

```bash
#Example
$ opencve create-user john john.doe@example.com --admin
```

If you chose to install the application with docker, you can use the following commands:

```bash
#Example
$ docker exec -it webserver opencve create-user john john.doe@example.com --admin
```

### The import functions
Those functions are stored int the `import` folder and are responsible for importing the data from the NIST database.

You may be familiar with the `import_data` function that is used to import the data from the NIST database when you install the application.

!!! note
    Every function must be declared in the `opencve/cli.py` file as follows:
    ```python	
    cli.add_command(import_data)
    ```	

Here is how it is declared as an example : 
```python
# Example
@click.command()
@click.option("--confirm", is_flag=True, help="Automatically confirm the prompt.")
@ensure_config
@with_appcontext
def import_data(confirm):
    """
    Perform initial imports (cve, cwe, cpe).
    """
    # Code to import the data...

```
