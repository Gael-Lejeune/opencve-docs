Users subscribe to vendors or products, and OpenCVE alerts them when a new CVE is created or when an update is done in an existing CVE. You can manually install OpenCVE, or use docker . We also provide a running instance on https://www.opencve.io if you don't want to host it yourself. How it Works OpenCVE uses the JSON feed provided by the NVD to update the local list of CVEs. After an initial import, a background task is regularly executed to synchronize the local copy with the NVD feed. If a new CVE is added, or if a change is detected, the subscribers of the related vendors and products are alerted. Info Read the dedicated documentation to learn in details how OpenCVE works. Requirements OpenCVE works with Python >=3.6 . It uses the JSONB feature for performance, so you will need a PostgreSQL instance to store the data (CVE, Users, Vendors, Products, Subscriptions, ...). Other engines are not supported. The pg_trgm module of PostgreSQL is required to let you search in the CVEs list. The upgrade-db command will enable it for you, but you can also do it yourself if you prefer ( CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm ). Celery is used to periodically fetch the NVD database and update the list of CVEs. For that you will need a broker : we recommend you Redis for the ease of installation. Futhermore it is possible that future versions of OpenCVE will use a cache feature, in that case the Redis requirement will already be filled for you. During the import of initial data OpenCVE will download and parse huge files, like the CPE dictionnary. For that we recommend you 3.5G RAM at least. Installation We provide 2 methods to install OpenCVE : manual installation docker installation The second method can be useful if you don't want to manage the dependencies (like PostgreSQL, Redis or Celery).

Info For now the only method of notification is the mail, but we work to add other integrations (webhooks, Slack, Jira, PagerDuty, OpsGenie...). Source of Data The first step, if you want to install OpenCVE, is to import the whole list of CVEs, CPEs and CWEs into a local PostgreSQL database. This is the job of the import-data command. Several files from the NVD and the MITRE are downloaded and parsed during its process: CPE: https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/xml/cpe/dictionary/official-cpe-dictionary_v2.3.xml.gz CWE: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_latest.xml.zip CVE: https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/json/cve/1.1/nvdcve-1.1-2021.json.gz https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/json/cve/1.1/nvdcve-1.1-2020.json.gz https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/json/cve/1.1/nvdcve-1.1-2019.json.gz [...] https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/json/cve/1.1/nvdcve-1.1-2002.json.gz Each CVE-20xx file is used to import all the existing CVE from 2002 (the full list of the JSON Feed can be found on the NVD website ): Info For those of you who are curious about the process of the import-data command, the code can be found in this folder: https://github.com/opencve/opencve/tree/master/opencve/commands/imports . After this process the local PostgreSQL instance is now populated, and OpenCVE can already be used to search and list CVEs, or filter them by CWE or Vendors/Products. Events and Changes New CVEs appear every day, so OpenCVE must synchronize the local database to reflect the changes. A periodic task is scheduled every 15 minutes to check the new changes: First the meta file is downloaded to compare the sha256 value with the last known in the database Then, if this checksum has changed, OpenCVE downloads the CVE-Modified file and check each CVE in it. Info The code of this process can be found here . For each CVE the lastModifiedDate field is compared with the value in the local database. If the date is not the same, it means something has changed: maybe it's the summary of the CVE, maybe a reference has been updated, maybe a CPE has been added, maybe its CVSS score changed, etc. To find what has really changed, OpenCVE executes a list of checks (the code is here ). Then it creates one or more events . And because a CVE can have multiple events in the same batch, these events are grouped into changes . The following events are supported: Type Triggered when new_cve A new CVE is created references The references list changes cpes The CPE list changes cvss The CVSSv2 or CVSSv3 scores change summary The summary changes cwes The CWE list changes For instance the CVE-2021-44228 has been modified the 20 Dec 2021: During this change, 2 events have been created ( cpes and references ): Finally the change is displayed in the homepage to the end user: Note Of course an alert is also sent to the users who suscribed to one or more vendors/products of this CVE.

Features that are specific to this fork Please not that this section is about features that are currently in progress or likely to evolve. This section may not be up to date. The complete CPE tag handling branch On this branch , the CPE tag handling is complete. You can follow CPE tags instead of products. It means that you can use the following syntax: cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:windows_10:1.2:*:*:*:*:*:* This way, you will be alerted if a CVE is published for a product that falls under this CPE tag like: cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:windows_10:*:*:*:*:*:*:* or cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:windows_10:1.2:18:*:*:*:*:* If you want to know how to use this specific branch, please refer to the installation instructions . Info You can search for the entire CPE tag of your product here . You can learn more on CPE tag here . Warning Please note that the CPE tag handling is not complete. This branch is still in development and may change in the future. Because of this, I advise you to use the master branch of the fork. It is also important to note that the app will run slower than on the master branch and a lot of heavy requests will be made to the database. You may experience some lag. Installation will also be a bit slower. The \"category\" system. You can view this as a \"category\" feature. The goal is to add a category, and to register several Vendors or products in it. This way, you can follow your category, and be alerted whenever something impacting it happens. You can also add vendors or products to a followed category on the vendor and product list by hand. Category model from opencve.context import _humanize_filter from opencve.extensions import db from opencve.models import BaseModel , categories_vendors , categories_products , users_categories class Category ( BaseModel ): __tablename__ = \"categories\" name = db . Column ( db .

We discussed those relationships before and how to create them in the init .py file. In admin.py, I needed to add the CategoryModelView as below : from opencve.models.categories import Category class CategoryModelView ( AuthModelView ): page_size = 20 create_modal = False edit_modal = False can_view_details = True column_list = [ \"name\" , \"created_at\" ] Category tables are now added automatically when building the project. Command to create a category The create_category.py script is used to create a category, it can be used as follows: docker exec -it webserver opencve create-category <category-name> A view to see all the existing categories The page templates/categories.html alongside views/category.py and controllers/subscriptions.py are used to view the category table and manage subscribtion for users. It is used exactly like the vendors page but to manage categories. A view to see the details of a category and modify it The user is now able to see and update the category subscribtions manually (we will see that next) or using an excel file. We can do that by navigating to \"/category/<category name>\". A new import function Using an excel file (.xlsx), the user can update the category products. The excel file format is described on the web page. Note CPE product tag only should be in the following format : my_product_name CPE complete tag should be in the following format : cpe:<cpe_version>:<part>:<vendor>:<product>:<version>:... Info You can search for the entire CPE tag here . You can learn more on CPE tag here . For the moment, the function is not perfectly optimized and can only use .xlsx files. Warning This operation may take several minutes depending on the size of you file. The read_excel is the function that will read the excel input and populate the database, it can be found at controllers/categories.py The searching function can be found in the same file. Updated Dashboard Updated dashboard to be able to see the CVEs related to a followed category. This was done by updating the template/home.html page alongside \"controllers/home.py\". The main code was to check the current user categories and add their respective vendors and products to the vendors list. Added category Action in vendor and products If the current user is following a category, he will be able to add new vendors and products to the category subscribtions directly from the vendors or products pages: Managing reports and emails In order to create alerts for users subscribed to a category we edited the tasks/alerts.py script # Product contains the separator if PRODUCT_SEPARATOR in v : vendor = Vendor . query . filter_by ( name = v . split ( PRODUCT_SEPARATOR )[ 0 ] ) . first () product = Product . query . filter_by ( name = v . split ( PRODUCT_SEPARATOR )[ 1 ], vendor_id = vendor . id ) . first () categories = Category . query . filter ( Category . products . contains ( product ) ) . all () for user in product . users : if user not in users . keys (): users [ user ] = { \"products\" : [], \"vendors\" : []} users [ user ][ \"products\" ] . append ( product . name ) for category in categories : for user in category . users : if user not in users . keys (): users [ user ] = { \"products\" : [], \"vendors\" : []} users [ user ][ \"products\" ] . append ( product . name ) # Vendor else : vendor = Vendor . query . filter_by ( name = v ) . first () categories = Category . query . filter ( Category . vendors . contains ( vendor ) ) . all () for user in vendor . users : if user not in users . keys (): users [ user ] = { \"products\" : [], \"vendors\" : []} users [ user ][ \"vendors\" ] . append ( vendor . name ) for category in categories : for user in category . users : if user not in users . keys (): users [ user ] = { \"products\" : [], \"vendors\" : []} users [ user ][ \"vendors\" ] . append ( vendor . name ) We loop through the user categories and select the vendors and products from them. This will create a list of users that will receive emails. Encountered problems When you want to upgrade the DB, you will sadly have to make clean and thus re-import the data. The \"import-light\" function may be optimized to make it even faster and thus help with this problem.

Please keep in mind that project is designed to be installed with our fork of opencve-docker . Requirements The current documentation has been tested on Debian 10 and Ubuntu LTS 20.04 with the following requirements : Docker-compose 1.21.0+ Docker 20.10.1+ 8 GB RAM If you want to know more about docker, you can read here . Clone the app and docker environnement Get the OpenCVE docker repository: $ git clone https://github.com/Gael-Lejeune/opencve-docker Then move into the directory (using the mv command) and run the following command to copy our fork of opencve : $ git clone https://github.com/Gael-Lejeune/opencve opencve Info If you want to use the cpe branch of the fork, you can run the following command instead: $ git clone https://github.com/Gael-Lejeune/opencve --branch cpe-version opencve Learn more about this branch here Installation steps Configuration Create a copy of the opencve.cfg.example file which is in the conf folder cp ./conf/opencve.cfg.example ./conf/opencve.cfg Edit the opencve.cfg file (remove the <> when you replace) server_name = <your_listening_ip>:8000 secret_key = \"<your_secret_key>\" Listening_ip can be setup to 127.0.0.1 Secret_key should be between quotes and be a randomly generated key containing at least 32 characters (see flask recommandations ). Update the SMTP Configuration For the moment, the outlook smtp server is unused, please keep in mind that the email functions are not working for the moment , you are not forced to configure it. [mail] ; Choices are 'smtp' or 'sendmail' email_adapter = smtp ; The 'From' field of the sent emails email_from = examplemail@outlook.com ; Configuration to set up SMTP mails. smtp_server = smtp.office365.com smtp_port = 587 smtp_use_tls = True smtp_username = examplemail@outlook.com smtp_password = examplepassword Note that the email_from and smtp_username should be the same. Check files & Line endings Make sure that ./conf/opencve.cfg and ./run.sh are LF line terminated (and not CRLF, it could cause errors while building or running the container) If you want to learn more about LF and CRLF you can click here . If you want to know how to change this using Visual Studio Code , or Notepad++ . Tip If you want to change the default postgresql password (strongly advised), you can add it in the .env file before the docker-compose build: POSTGRES_PASSWORD=MyStrongPassword42 Then don't forget to change it in the opencve.cfg file. Info You will need a SMTP server to send the notification emails. Its configuration is out of scope of this procedure. Initialize the stack All the following commands need to be used in a terminal, in the root folder of the project (you should be able to see files like \"Dockerfile\") You can now build the OpenCVE image. $ docker-compose build Then start everything except the beat: $ docker-compose up -d postgres redis webserver celery_worker Initialize the database The database can be initialized with the following command: $ docker exec -it webserver opencve upgrade-db Import the data The tables are created, you can now populate them using the import-data command : $ docker exec -it webserver opencve import-data This command download the list of CPE, the list of CWE and each CVE's year (from 2002 until now), so it can take several minutes . Don't worry you will only do it once. Note Alternatively, you can use the following command to import less CVEs, making it a bit faster and more suitable for testing. docker exec -it webserver opencve import-data-light Warning The NVD data are downloaded, extracted and then parsed in-memory before being inserted in the database. For that the import-data command needs 5GB at least to correctly do its job. Afterwards, the worker use very small memory as only the diff is used with the NVD. If you launch opencve import-data without this memory space the command will be killed (OOM) by your operating system and your data will be incompletes. We wrote a documentation to handle this problem using a SWAP file. Create an admin You can now create the admin : $ docker exec -it webserver opencve create-user john john.doe@example.com --admin Password: Repeat for confirmation: [*] User john created. Tip This command is required for the first admin, then you will be able to manage the users with the admin pages .

Please refer to the docker installation instructions for more information. OpenCVE can simply be installed using pip : $ pip install opencve Configuration file OpenCVE uses an opencve.cfg file to handle its configuration (database access, mail config, pagination...). So the first step is to create this configuration file. You can do it with the init command : $ opencve init [*] Configuration created in /Users/ncrocfer/opencve/opencve.cfg Tip A custom path can be specified in the OPENCVE_CONFIG environment variable. Check the init documentation for more details. Initialize the database The database is configured with the database_uri variable of the opencve.cfg file : $ vim ~/opencve/opencve.cfg ... database_uri = postgresql://john:mysupersecret@servername:5432/opencve ... Once done the upgrade-db command will create all the tables : $ opencve upgrade-db Because it uses the JSONB feature for performance, OpenCVE only supports PostgreSQL . The pg_trgm module of PostgreSQL is required to let you search in the CVEs list. The upgrade-db command will enable it for you, but you can also do it yourself if you prefer ( CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm ). Info From PostgreSQL 13 this module is considered as trusted, meaning it can be installed by non-superusers with the CREATE privilege.
